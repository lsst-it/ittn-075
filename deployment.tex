\section{IPsec Tunnels Deployment}

\subsection{Hardware Location}
At SLAC, the IPsec switches were installed at:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item SRCF located in row T1 and row T2
        \item Rack is commonly called "Embargo"
        \item Used as TOR switches for the Embargo storage cluster
    \end{itemize}

At Rubin, the IPsec switches were installed at:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Summit Data Center at Cerro Pach√≥n
        \item Rack SDC-A02
        \item Used as TOR switches for the Rubin LFA cluster
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Rubin MLAG Configuration}
Both sites are using their respective nodes in MLAG fashion. To see the full MLAG configuration for Rubin IPsec MLAG setup, you can find it here: \href{https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/IT/ITTN-075+-+Rubin+IPsec+MLAG+Configuration}{Rubin IPsec MLAG Configuration}

\subsection{Summit to Base connection for IPsec switches}
The IPsec switches are directly connected to the base using the DWDM and into the Rubin border routers, the detailed diagram of those 4 x 100Gbps connections can be found here: \href{https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/IT/ITTN-075+-+Rubin+IPsec-to-BRs}{Rubin IPsec-to-BRs}
